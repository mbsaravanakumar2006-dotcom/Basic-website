    <p>The Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) is an Indian regional political party founded on February 2, 2024, by the popular actor-turned-politician Vijay, who serves as its president. The party's core ideology is rooted in secular social justice principles, advocating for an egalitarian society where "all beings are equal by birth" (based on the Tamil maxim "Pirappokkum ella uyirkkum"). Its stated goals include promoting social justice, equality, secularism, and state autonomy, as well as working towards a drug-free and corruption-free Tamil Nadu. The TVK aims to challenge the long-standing dominance of the two major Dravidian parties (DMK and AIADMK) and has declared its intention to come to power by winning the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. The party has faced significant public scrutiny, including an incident in September 2025 where a stampede at one of its rallies in Karur resulted in 41 deaths, an event that led to legal proceedings and a call for a CBI inquiry.</p>
